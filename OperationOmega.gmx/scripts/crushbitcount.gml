//ALL ARGUMENTS/RETURNS ARE REAL NUMBERS, UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE
/*
Script name: crushbitcount
Arguments: 
none

Returns:
Returns how many bits were uncrushed/crushed.
only works after crush(); or uncrush();
otherwise, -1 will be returned.

this really depends on the range, the bigger the rangem the more bits are written. (try to minmize the range!)
note: a range of -50 - +100 uses as much bits as a range of 0 - 100
